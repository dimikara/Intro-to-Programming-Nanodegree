# **Intro to Programming Nanodegree (Udacity, 2020)**

A repository for the projects that I have done during my Udacity **Intro to Programming Nanodegree**.

## **Project 1:** <a href="https://codepen.io/dimitraK/full/rprEzy/" target="_blank">**Animal Trade Card**</a>

An **exercise** to use what I have learned about **CSS** to **convert** a design prototype into a functional webpage. The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features the animal of my choice.

## **Project 2:** <a href="https://github.com/dimikara/Adventure_Game" target="_blank">**Adventure Game**</a>

For this project, I built a simple version of an old-fashioned **text-based adventure game**. The goal was to make use of my Python skills.
